LaTeX Source for course materials and compendium for DFAK4304 at EDE@NTNU

If contributing : Please read HELDEKKENDE and keep an eye out for changes in the structure

(It'd be nice if you made a branch for the chapters you're working on)

Oh, yeah. If you're typesetting, please run pdflatex in build/ as **pdflatex ../book.tex** (I'm making it easy for you)

«Oh, yeah», if you'll be wanting to start a new chapter, the chapter headings are formatted not with \section{}, but with *\kapittelhode{}*.
